Welcome to the Task Manager web application. This tool allows you to create, track, and manage your tasks efficiently. Simply enter the task details, and you can keep your work organized and on track.

Project Walkthrough

First,  you have to create a folder on a local machine or in Git Hub. For this project, I created the repository on GitHub and cloned it using the  command git clone and then the repository name.  I then created three files index.html, index.css,  and index.js for the development. 

Usage Instructions
Registration and Login:

To get started, you need to either register a new account or log in with your existing credentials.
After successfully logging in, you'll gain access to your personalized task dashboard.
Task Management:

You can create new tasks by filling out the title, description, and due date fields and clicking the "Add Task" button.
Existing tasks are displayed in a list format, showing the task title, description (if provided), due date, and status.
You can update task status by clicking on the task's status field, which toggles between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
To edit or delete a task, click on the task itself to view its details.
Sorting and Filtering:

Tasks can be sorted by due date or title by clicking on the respective column headers.
Filters are available to show tasks due today, this week, or all tasks, making it easy to focus on specific categories.
Profile Management:

Users have the option to update their profile information and change their password.
To organize and represent tasks consistently, we created a JavaScript class named Task. This class includes properties such as title, description, dueDate, and status. 

Switch Statement (Task Status)
The website uses a switch statement to handle task status changes when users interact with tasks.


Try-Catch-Finally Statement
While not demonstrated in the provided code, try-catch-finally statements are vital for handling potential errors, especially in complex operations like data fetching from a server. 

I have deployed the website on firebase.
